 - size decrease chance porportional to current size (smaller -> less likely to get even smaller)
 - split probability inversely proportional to number of worms living (more worms -> less likely to split)
 - split probability inversely proportional to size (bigger -> less likely to split)
 - flowers when the branches are small enough
